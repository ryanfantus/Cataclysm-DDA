# Catalcysm: Dark Days Ahead - BBS Doorgame Fork

Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a roguelike set in a post-apocalyptic world. While some have described it as a "zombie game", there is far more to Cataclysm than that. Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for food, equipment, or, if you are lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the hell out of Dodge. Fight to defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from zombies to giant insects to killer robots and things far stranger and deadlier, and against the others like yourself, who want what you have...

This particular fork is intended to reconfigure the game to function as a BBS door. Goals will be to make entire game as playable as possible in an 80x25 terminal window with a character set acceptable to cp437 "ansi-bbs" type clients.\

This will forever be a work in progress.
